First off, some useful URLs:

https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld2
https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/

Loose approach to Raijin:

STEP 1: Log in.
https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/How+to+login+to+Raijin
Summarised: just open a Linux terminal and go:
ssh abc123@raijin.nci.org.au
(where abc123 is replaced with your username, in my case rb9096)
You are now ssh'ed into Raijin land. This means you've basically logged in to a remote computer.
Read all about ssh here:
https://www.ssh.com/ssh/command/

STEP 2:
Get planetengine:
git clone https://github.com/rsbyrne/planetengine.git
This will create a folder called planetengine.
Navigate to this folder:
cd planetengine
This is where all your work will be done.
It comes with the file structure already in place
to make everything work properly.
Now you must get Underworld2:
sh raijinuw.sh
(this is just a copy of: underworld2/docs/install_guides/nci_raijin.sh)
This will create a folder called underworld containing all the code needed to make underworld work.
(i.e. it's what is referred to when you go 'import underworld')

STEP 3:
Check the jobscript:
nano jobscript
Make sure everything's right.
Check the python script:
nano localscript.py
Make sure everything's right.

STEP 4:
Submit the jobscript:
qsub jobscript
Write down your jobid!
(On Raijin it should look something like: 1234.r-man2)

STEP 5:
Check on your job:
qstat -s jobid
...where 'jobid' is the jobid you cleverly jotted down earlier)

STEP 6:
Recover your data.
Not sure how yet???
But probably can be done using the usual SSH interface,
copying stuff from my instance of Raijin to my local device
or even uploading it somewhere (if I'm really clever).
Might also be possible just to push everything back up to git.
